I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLab)](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Christian A. Naesseth](https://naesseth.github.io/). Previously, I completed my Masterâ€™s in Data Science at the Higher School of Economics, under the supervision of [Dmitry Vetrov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7HU0UoUAAAAJ).

I work in the field of Deep Learning, with research interests focused on Generative Models, particularly Diffusion Models.
